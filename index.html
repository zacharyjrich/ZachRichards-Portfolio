          <p><strong>Background - </strong>I have spent most of my working years in the retail and restaurant business. I've also been fortunate enough to play drums in a few projects that allowed me to tour all over America and a see some of Europe. I've spent the last 2 years as a stay at home dad for my 3 year old girl and 1 year old little boy. It has been a wonderful experience getting to be with them and see them grow from birth. I am excited, however, to continue with the Epicodus program and see if I can find a new, creative and rewarding career.</p>

          <p><strong>Interests - </strong>While music has long been my main focus and passion, I spent most of my youth playing sports and aspiring to be a professional athlete. I have taken up golf in recent years, and while the game quite often gets the best of me, it's been a rewarding process to see the improvements since I started. I continue to play drums in a couple of projects and music will always be my favorite form of natural and emotional expression. Lastly, I really enjoy cooking and baking at home for my family and friends. This last year I made my own yeast starter and am obsessed with making pizza and bread.</p>
